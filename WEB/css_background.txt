Background.
    This css property is used for setting a background image/color to the element. 

    Here's what may be used as a value of the property:
    * name of a color (red | green | yellow)
    * HTML name of a color(#ffffff, #7b917b)
    * default value (initial)
    * ingerited value (inherit)

    We can set an image as a background:
    * absolute path to the image: background-image: url('https://clck.ru/T6MJV');
    * relative path to the image: background-image: assets/images/01.jpg
    * gradient: background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow)

    By defaule background images are stiked to the top-left corner of viewport and displayes in their natural size.

Background-repeat

    Makes the image repeat itself on the X or Y axis if it's smaller than the viewport. 
    Valid values:
        * repeat
        * no-repeat
        * repeat-x | repeat-yellow

Background-attachment
    Background image is either scrolled with the content or stays in place.
    Values:
        * scroll
        * fixed

    Example:
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title></title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <div class="content">
                <div class="scroll"></div>
            </div>
        </body>
    </html>    

    .content {
      height: 200px;
      max-width: 450px;
      overflow-x: hidden;
      overflow-y: scroll;
      width: 50%;
    }

    .scroll {
      background: url(back.png);
      height: 300px;
      background-attachment: scroll;
    }

Background-position:
    Sets background positioning from the default position(top-left corner) to any other 
    position you want.
        * top | left | bottom | right | <value>% values set the gap between one side of the viewport
                                                 and the image
        * center value makes the image centered on both x and y axis.

    The property works with two set values, where first defines horizontal margins and the second one 
    defines vertical margins. If there's only one value defined, the second one will be set to center.

Background-size:
    Sets the size for the background image. Values:
    * <value>% scales image proportionally and makes it bigger/smaller than its actual size
        example: background-size: 50%
    * contains - scales the image proportionally so its height or width matches height or width
                of the viewport and it is not cropped 
        example: background-size: contain;
    * cover - scales the image proportionally so its height or width matches heigth or width of the viewport to ffffff  
                fill the viewport
    
    For example, the following code sample will make the background twice as bigger as the size of the block:
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <title></title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div class="container">
      </div>
    </body>
    </html>

    .container {
     background: url('bg1.jpg');
     background-size: 200%;
     background-repeat: no-repeat;
     border: 4px solid #2778f6;
     color: #294360;
     font-size: 2em;
     min-height: 80vh;
     overflow: auto;
     width: 60vw;
    }

    Determines background display area. Values:
        * border-box
        * padding-box
        * content-box
