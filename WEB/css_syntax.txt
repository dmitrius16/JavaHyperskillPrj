Basic syntax:
    
    selector { property: value; }
    
    1. Selector indicates which HTML elements the styles will be applied to.
    
        h1 { color: red; }
        
        In this case, the style will apply to all <h1> elements on the page. The text
        of the <h1> elements will turn red.
        
        You can write multiple selectors separated by commas:
        
        h1, p { color: red; }
        
        Here, styles are applied to two HTML tags at once. All <h1> and <p> elements
        on the web page will have a red text color.
        
    2. Declaration block

        Declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. 
        Several declarations look like this:
        
        div {
            width: 500px;
            height: 50px;
            color: yellow;
        }
