1. CSS element selector
    CSS element selector are most elementary and easy-to-use selectors.
    As selector we use the name of the HTML element to which you want to apply it

    p {
        color: brown;
    }

2. CSS id selector

    A symbol # is placed in front of it so that the browser understands that this is as id selector

    css file:
    #big {
        font-size: 30px;
    }

    html file:
    <p id="big">The text of this paragraph will change in font size.</p>
    <p>This one won't change size.</p>
    <p>This one won't too.</p>

3. CSS class Selector is useful when you need to give a lot different elements
the same look. The name of the selector is taken from the value of the class attribute of the desired HTML tag.

    css code:
    .blue {
        background-color: blue;
    }

    html code:

    <h1 class="blue">The background color of this element should be blue.</h1>
    <p class="blue">This too.</p>
    <p>And this one will remain without a beautiful background.</p>
