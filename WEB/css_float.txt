In the old days of web development, when there were no flexbox and grid properties for
creating layouts, the float property was widely used.

1. What is float used for?
    The float property is commonly used when we want a block of text to flow around an image or 
    want an element to stand next to another element. Some web developers even use it to create layouts, 
    but properties like XSS flexbox xan do this more efficiently.
    
    With the float property defined, an element can be pushed to the left or right, thus allowing the next
    element on the webpage (or the next element in the flow) to float around it. Float is useful in these situations
    because no other CSS property can achieve the same result.
    
    To work with float, we first need a container. In other words, the element we want to float needs 
    to be contained within a parent element. Neither the element we want to float or its parent element can have their 
    position set to absolute because elements with this setting are removed from the flow of the webpage.
    
    The values we can use with the float property are as follows:
    
        * left: The element will float to the left side of its parent.
        * rigth: The elment will float to the right side of its parent.
        * inherit: The element will inherit the float value from its parent.
