To create database, you can uses CREATE DATABASE statement.
Let's create an empty database that stores information about university students and name it students:

CREATE DATABASE students;

Let's keep working with our students database and create a table students_info that will contain
four column: students_id, name, surname age.

CREATE TABLE students_info (
    students_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(30),
    surname VARCHAR(30),
    age INT
);

As a result, we have an empty taable students_info

+----------+----------+------------+------------+
|student_id|   name   |  surname   |   age      |
+----------+----------+------------+------------+



Drop a database

To delete a database, use DROP DATABASE statement:

DROP DATABASE students;
