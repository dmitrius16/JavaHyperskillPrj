Declare secondary constructor:

Example:
    
class Size {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0
    
    constructor(_width: Int, _height: Int) {
        width = _height
        height = _height
    }
}

Creating objects:

    val size1 = Size(3, 4)
    val size2 = Size(5, 1)

    if you declare your own constructor you can't use implicit constructor:

    val size = Size() // Error! No values passed for parameters

    I have to explicitly define default constructor

    class Size {
        var width: Int = 0
        var height: Int = 0
        
        constructor(_width: Int, _height: Int) {
            width = _height
            height = _height
        }
        
        constructor() {
        }
    }

Constructor execution:

    If a class has a primary constructor, each secondary constructor needs to call the primary constuctor!!!
    Either directly or indirectly through another secondary constructor.

    Delegation to another constructor of the same class is done with the keyword this placed after the constructor
    arguments and before the constructor body

    class Size(val width: Int, val height: Int) {
        var area: Int = width * height
        
        init {
            println("Objects with area equal to $area is created")
        }
        
        constructor(width: Int, height: int, outerSize: Size) : this(width, height) {
            outerSize.area -= this.area
            println("Updated outer object's area is equal to ${outerSize.area}")
        }
    }
    
 if a class has no primary constructor, the delegation still happens implicitly, and initializer blocks are 
 still executed:
    class Size {
        var width: Int = 0
        var height: Int = 0

        init {
            println("Init block; width = $width, height = $height")
        }

        constructor(width: Int, height: Int) {
            this.width = width
            this.height = height
            println("Secondary constructor block; width = $width, height = $height")
        }
    }
 
    val size = Size(5, 6)
Code output:
    Init block; width = 0, height = 0
    Secondary constructor block; width = 5, height = 6
