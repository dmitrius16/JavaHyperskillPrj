Defining classes:

class Size {
    var width: Int = 1
    var height: Int = 1
}

Create instance of class:

val size = Size()

Primary constructor. It does not contain any code, it just initializes an instance of a class and its properties.

class Size(width: Int, height: Int) {
    val width: Int = width
    val height: Int = height
    val area: Int = width * height
}

Property declaration:
You can put simple property declaration inside the primary constructor. To declare a read-only property, put
the keyword val in the parentheses before the argument name. For a mutable property, use keyword var

class Size(val width: Int, height: Int) {
    val height: Int = height
    val area: Int = width * height
}

Default and named arguments alse works

Single line classes a.k.a data classes

class Size(val: width, val: height)

Primary constuctors cannot contain any code: they only set the values of class properties based on the 
passed arguments. Sometimes we want to set some of our properties based on other properties' values or other
sources of information. In such cases, we would use initializer blocks, which are prefixed with the keyword init:

class Size(_width: Int, _height: Int) {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0

    init {
        width = if (_width >= 0) _width else {
            println("Error, the width should be a non-negative value")
            0
        }

        height = if (_height >= 0) _height else {
            println("Error, the height should be a non-negative value")
            0
        }
    }
}

The keyword init signifies a block of code that serves as an extension of the primary constructor.
